Meal Prep Guru is an app where you can search for recipes, add recipes to your favorites list and even create your own meal plan.

When you search for recipes, you can narrow your search by selecting cuisine, allergies, and number of results to be displayed.

When recipes are shown, you can add them to your favorites and/or see the ingredients list and cooking instructions for that meal.

When creating your own meal plan, you can use the recipes already on your favorites list or search for something new. At the bottom of the calendar you will see nutritional info for the entire day, including the amount of calories, carbs, fat and protein.

When you hover over the image of a recipe, three options will be displayed: duplicate, view recipe and remove. Duplicate will add another copy of the recipe to the calendar, view recipe will take you to a website that shows the ingredients and instructions to make the meal and remove will delete the recipe from you meal plan.
